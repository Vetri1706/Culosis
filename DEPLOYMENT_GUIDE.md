```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Verify all features work:
# - 3D scene renders correctly
# - Character models animate
# - Particle effects display
# - All themes load properly
# - Decision making functions
# - Score tracking works
```

### 3. Deploy to Reddit

```bash
# Deploy to Reddit Devvit platform
npm run deploy

# Follow prompts to select subreddit
# Verify deployment success
```

### 4. Create Demo Post

- Four apocalyptic themes (Zombie, Pandemic, Alien, Nuclear)
- Interactive security cameras and holographic displays
- Professional lighting and particle effects
- Progressive difficulty levels

## 🏆 Built for Reddit Hackathon

This game showcases advanced 3D graphics in a Reddit app, built with:

- Three.js + React Three Fiber
- TypeScript + Devvit platform
- AI-assisted development with Kiro

Try it now and help secure the border! 🛡️
```

### Demo Post Best Practices

1. **Clear Instructions**: Make gameplay immediately understandable
2. **Visual Appeal**: Mention the 3D graphics and effects
3. **Engagement**: Encourage community interaction and scoring
4. **Technical Highlights**: Showcase the innovation for judges

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

```javascript
// Monitor these in production
const performanceMetrics = {
  frameRate: '60fps target',
  loadTime: '<3 seconds',
  bundleSize: '1.27MB (368KB gzipped)',
  memoryUsage: '<100MB',
  errorRate: '<0.1%',
};
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Slow Loading**: Check 3D asset optimization
2. **Low FPS**: Reduce particle count or shadow quality
3. **Memory Leaks**: Ensure proper Three.js cleanup
4. **Mobile Issues**: Test responsive 3D controls
