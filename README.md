### Four Unique Apocalyptic Scenarios

Each theme features completely distinct gameplay mechanics, document requirements, and specialized screening protocols with dynamic immigrant generation:

- **üßü Zombie Apocalypse**: Screen survivors for infection signs with temperature monitoring (must be <39¬∞C), visual bite mark detection, cognitive assessment, and blood type verification. Look for pale complexion, glazed eyes, and abnormal behavior patterns. Violations include high fever (>39¬∞C), visible bite marks, and abnormal cognitive responses. Characters show realistic infection symptoms and backstories.

- **ü¶† Disease Pandemic**: Verify vaccination status with comprehensive symptom screening, temperature checks (<37.5¬∞C), health certificate validation, and symptom tracking. Watch for coughing, fever symptoms, and missing vaccination documentation. Violations include missing vaccination certificates, persistent cough symptoms, and elevated temperature (>37.5¬∞C). Dynamic symptom generation affects character appearance.

- **üëΩ Alien Invasion**: Identify alien imposters using advanced DNA scanners, biometric verification, anomaly detection systems, and biological marker analysis. Detect "too perfect" appearances and failed biometric scans. Violations include anomalous DNA structure, non-human signatures, and biometric mismatches. Subtle visual cues indicate non-human entities.

- **‚ò¢Ô∏è Nuclear Fallout**: Monitor radiation levels (<0.5 Sv) with contamination screening, decontamination certificates, origin verification, and exposure assessment. Check for radiation burns, hair loss, and high exposure readings. Violations include excessive radiation levels (>0.5 Sv), missing decontamination certificates, and origin from restricted red zones. Visual radiation effects on character portraits.

### Advanced Character Intelligence System

## üéØ Pro Tips for High Scores

### Investigation Strategy

1. **Always Investigate First**: Decision buttons won't activate until you use tools or ask questions - use this time wisely
2. **Use Tools Strategically**: Each tool can only be used once per immigrant, so choose based on theme and suspected violations
3. **Ask Targeted Questions**: Questions can only be asked once, so focus on areas where you suspect inconsistencies
4. **Read Everything Carefully**: Cross-reference names, dates, and information across all documents for inconsistencies
5. **Watch the Investigation Log**: Monitor your evidence-gathering in real-time to build a complete case

### Theme-Specific Tips

6. **Zombie Theme**: Focus on temperature readings (>39¬∞C is dangerous), look for bite mark descriptions, check cognitive responses
7. **Pandemic Theme**: Verify vaccination status, check for symptoms, monitor temperature (>37.5¬∞C is concerning)
8. **Alien Theme**: Look for "too perfect" appearances, check DNA scan results for "anomalous" or "non-human" readings
9. **Nuclear Theme**: Monitor radiation levels (>0.5 Sv is dangerous), check for burn descriptions, verify decontamination certificates

### Document Analysis

10. **Check Expiry Dates**: Expired documents are common violations - always verify dates carefully
11. **Compare Names**: Look for mismatches between claimed identity and document names
12. **Cross-Reference Medical Data**: Temperature, vaccination status, and symptoms should match across documents
13. **Read Personal Statements**: Stories may contain details that contradict other evidence

### Scoring Optimization

14. **Build Streaks**: Focus on accuracy over speed - consecutive correct decisions earn up to +100 bonus points
15. **Understand Risk Levels**: High-risk immigrants (50 pts) are worth more than low-risk (20 pts) but are harder to assess correctly
16. **Learn from Feedback**: Detailed explanations help you recognize similar patterns in future cases
17. **Track Your Performance**: Monitor accuracy percentage and adjust investigation thoroughness accordingly

- **Examine Multiple Documents** including passports, entry permits, health certificates, personal statements, and theme-specific scan results

- **Master Four Unique Themes** each with specialized violation types, temperature thresholds, and investigation priorities (Zombie, Pandemic, Alien, Nuclear)
- **Experience Authentic Interface** with retro terminal styling, professional checkpoint layout, and realistic investigation workflow
- **Track Performance Metrics** through persistent Reddit integration with score, accuracy, streak tracking, and comprehensive statistics

The game's innovative mandatory investigation system prevents rushing through cases, requiring players to gather evidence through tools and questioning before making approve/deny decisions. With realistic character generation, comprehensive document verification, and detailed feedback systems, every case becomes a thorough investigation challenge that teaches proper security protocols.
